# Why students haven't enjoyed to learn in school?

Hello guys, I know you're tired of studying in school and so bored with the teacher that gives 
    you a lot of homework, memorizing and preparing for the examination and forgetting everything, 
    and this is the reason why students haven't enjoyed to learn in school? 

## Education system is outdated

It cannot be denied that the education system is outdated because we must learn something useless 
    or won't use it in the future. (e.g., Reciting the periodic table, it's very difficult to memorize 
    the whole periodic table, or reciting poetry.) 

## Study for exam and then forget it

Teachers right now taught the students to memorize the information for the exam more than taught 
    students to have creativity or inspire students to have the passion to do in the future. 

## Students have a lot of homeworks

It cannot be denied that every day students have homework for every subject to do for marks. Some 
    students don't have time to find themselves what do they want to do when they grow up.

## Limited Of Learning

Some parents want their children to be doctors, and engineers for money and didn't think their son 
    what do son what to do, so parents push their children's tuition and pay more money to expect a 
    child to get A+ grades. This case will have a problem when children don't want to be that parents 
    want their children to be something that doesn't want to be. 

## Follow the direction

People who have been taught in school are to follow the direction so, students have to download 
    knowledge that students don't know when it has to use in future and student must use skills to 
    work in future but the school doesn't teach? The education system did not let students make 
    mistakes otherwise, students will be punished.
